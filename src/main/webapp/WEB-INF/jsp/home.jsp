	<p>
	<hr />

	<p>The first step to any successful study is good experimental
		design. The VANTAGE/VANGARD team can assist you in designing your
		genomics experiment to answer the research question of interest.</p>

	<p>
		Each Tuesday, VANTAGE/VANGARD personnel host a genomic design studio
		(GDS), in the format of office hours, to answer investigator questions
		and provide direction on experimental design. Studio participation is
		limited to ${limitUserCount} investigators per Tuesday; please click
		on the <a href="showlist.html">Schedule</a> link above to register for
		an upcoming studio.
	</p>

	<p>Studios run from 12:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m., with lunch served
		(must sign up by 10am the Friday prior to studio to guarantee a boxed
		lunch), in MCN A0207 (VANTAGE offices).</p>
