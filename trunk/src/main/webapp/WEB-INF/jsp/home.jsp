	<p>The first step to any successful study is good experimental
		design. The VANTAGE/VANGARD team can assist you in designing your
		genomics experiment to ensure the ability to answer your research
		question of interest.</p>

	<p>Each Tuesday, VANTAGE/VANGARD personnel host a genomic design
		studio (GDS), in the format of office hours, to answer investigator
		questions and provide direction on experimental design. Studio
		participation is limited to 15 investigators per Tuesday; please click
		on the <a href="showlist.html">"Schedule"</a> link above to register for an upcoming studio.</p>

	<p>Studios run from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., with lunch served, in
		MCN A0207 (VANTAGE offices).</p>
